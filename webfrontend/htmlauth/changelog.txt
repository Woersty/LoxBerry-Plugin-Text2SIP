SIP calls now work reliably on systems with Docker installed.

Wrapper automatically isolates docker0 and restores it after each call.

Compatible with all existing Text2SIP configurations.

Logs clearly to /opt/loxberry/log/plugins/text2speech/Text2SIP.log.

No need for manual ip link set docker0 down anymore.
